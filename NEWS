New in release 1.3 
------------------ 

Bugfix: Vivek Singh corrected a fairly
major problem in the TBSpline::bendingEnergy() function.  This is especially
important to users of N3.

Bugfix: Added "if(_debug)" to suppress some debug statements in
CachedArray.cc and SimpleArray.cc

Build change: EBTKS now includes the bits of CLAPACK required to link
with the TBSpline object.  It is no longer necessary to build or
install a separate LAPACK library.

New in release 1.2
------------------ 

Bugfix release.  CachedArray class should now work, and so should N3
and inormalize as a result.

New in release 1.1
------------------
Bugfix release.  No user-visible changes.

New in release 1.0

* Now builds with g++ 3.2, g++ 2.96, and IRIX CC 7.30
* Substantial restructuring was required to accomplish this, but no
  significant functional changes should have been made.

New in Release 0.99

* autoconfiscated and builds with (only?) gcc version 3
