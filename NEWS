New in Release 1.6.4
--------------------
Moved splines from EBTKS to N3

New in Release 1.6.3
--------------------
Changes for build with gcc 4.3

New in Release 1.6.2
--------------------
Fixed a bug in the splines to make N3 invariant to voxel sizes.
Added destructors for the spline classes to free the memory.

New in Release 1.6.1
--------------------
Added a bug fix for TBSpline that was manifested in certain cases in nu_correct
as "inputCompactField(): Incorrect number of coefficients"

New in release 1.5
------------------
Fix for temp file creation in src/FileIO.cc

New in release 1.4
------------------
Build fixes for GCC 3.4.X

New in release 1.3 
------------------ 

Bugfix: Vivek Singh corrected a fairly
major problem in the TBSpline::bendingEnergy() function.  This is especially
important to users of N3.

Bugfix: Added "if(_debug)" to suppress some debug statements in
CachedArray.cc and SimpleArray.cc

Build change: EBTKS now includes the bits of CLAPACK required to link
with the TBSpline object.  It is no longer necessary to build or
install a separate LAPACK library.

New in release 1.2
------------------ 

Bugfix release.  CachedArray class should now work, and so should N3
and inormalize as a result.

New in release 1.1
------------------
Bugfix release.  No user-visible changes.

New in release 1.0

* Now builds with g++ 3.2, g++ 2.96, and IRIX CC 7.30
* Substantial restructuring was required to accomplish this, but no
  significant functional changes should have been made.

New in Release 0.99

* autoconfiscated and builds with (only?) gcc version 3
