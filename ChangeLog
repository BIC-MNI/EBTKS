-- Release of ebtks 1.6.2 --

2010-05-19  Andrew Janke  <a.janke@gmail.com>
   * added some C++ fixes regarding templates via Vladimir for gcc 4.3

2010-02-23  Andrew Janke  <a.janke@gmail.com>
   * removed all rcsid[]'s

2009-05-08  Andrew + Claude  <a.janke@gmail.com>
   * Fixed a bug in the splines to make N3 invariant to voxel sizes.
   * Added destructors for the spline classes to free the memory.

2006-06-29  Andrew + Claude  <a.janke@gmail.com>
   * Changed the code by EPSILON for generating the number of co-efficients in
      a TBSpline. -- This was causing an esoteric error with nu_correct when
      imp files were written out with %15g and were thus rounded.

   * src/FileIO.cc - in get_temp_filename(), add an explicit path to 
   the template passed to mkstemp() to avoid creating the temporary 
   file in the current directory.
   
2005-03-16  Andrew Janke   <a.janke@gmail.com>
   * Added epm-header.in

2004-12-08  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Various changes for building against GCC 3.4.X
   
2004-04-08  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Add CLAPACK sources to the distribution.

   * In TBSpline.cc changed iterating variables from unsigned
   to signed in the method bendingEnergy.  This is necessary
   to deal with possibility negative results when calculating
   index values.  The change appears to fix the incorrect bias field
   with N3 under IRIX and the 0 field estimates seen under linux.

2004-02-13  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   
   * In CachedArray.cc, uncommented bits that actually
   read/wrote/opened the cache file.  Also, fstream::open() requires
   the "trunc" attribute to be set in order to create a new file, as
   of GCC 3.0 and later.
   
   * Sadly, EBTKS now uses tempnam() so the annoying linker warning
   is back in some versions of GCC.  I promise to fix this someday...
   
2004-01-29  Bert Vincent   <bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * Include config.h in templates/MatrixSupport.cc so that the
   HAVE_MALLOC_H is defined!

   * Use explicit "C" linkage for isfinite()/finite() in SimpleArray.cc
   and SimpleArraySpec.cc
   
2004-01-19  Jason Lerch      <jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>

   * added checks for values.h and malloc.h and changed the includes
   where necessary. This fixes a compilation problem on OS 10.3

2002-09-04   Jason Lerch   <jason@bic.mni.mcgill.ca>
   * ugly hack in Matrix.h on line 1004. See documentation in code to
   understand just how ugly the hack really is!.
