This is a new version of the EBTKS library which has been tested with
the following compilers and systems:

g++ 2.96 / Linux
g++ 3.2  / IRIX
CC 7.30  / IRIX

The code should be functionally identical to EBTKS 0.99.

Building with GNU g++ should be straightforward, just unpack the
archive and issue the commands './configure' and 'make'.

If you wish to compile with IRIX CC, you need to set the environment
variables CC and CXX to appropriate values.  If the compiler is
installed in /usr/bin, you would type the following:

setenv CC /usr/bin/cc
setenv CXX "/usr/bin/CC -LANG:std"
./configure
make

The -LANG:std flag is required with IRIX CC in order to support the
modern C++ standard header files.

There will be several warnings issued during compilation.  I'm still
looking into fixing these.

Good luck.  Please report any problems to bert@bic.mni.mcgill.ca
